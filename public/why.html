    <h2>Why Curious Trio?</h2>
    <p>Curious Trio is a project that's come out of hello dang's incubator. Dang Nguyen has spent fifteen years as an operating executive across digital businesses. Witnessing the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6fb1602d-a08b-4a8c-bac0-047b7d64aba5"> Enshittification</a> of marketplaces first-hand, one of the first challenges he wanted to address was the underlying pay-to-play dynamic that exists in product discovery. </p>
    <p>We believe in enhancing your search experience by eliminating distractions. At Curious Trio, you wonâ€™t find any ads, just clean, unbiased search results to help you make informed decisions. We're working to make Curious Trio, product first, and retailer agnostic.</p>
    <p>Our mission is to provide a space where consumers can research products and topics without being bombarded by paid advertisements, maximizing the relevance and neutrality of the information presented.</p>
    <p>By focusing solely on delivering high-quality content without ads, we empower our users to research effectively, leading to better, more informed decisions without any commercial influence.</p>
    <p>Transparently, the idea is to earn affiliate commisions on any purchases that are made from the site. To remove bias from this - we do not change search results based on product or retailer agreements. They're purely unfiltered (except for paid ads) results.</p>
